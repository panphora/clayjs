/**
 * Unsaved Warning Module
 *
 * Warns users before leaving the page if there are unsaved changes.
 * Self-contained: compares current page content to last saved content on beforeunload.
 *
 * Works independently of autosave - no mutation observer needed during editing,
 * just a single comparison when the user tries to leave.
 *
 * Both current and stored content have [save-remove] stripped, so comparison is
 * direct with no parsing needed. [save-ignore] / no-trigger-autosave regions are
 * KEPT here: they don't trigger an autosave, so an edit in one is precisely the
 * kind that would be lost without a warning.
 *
 * Requires the 'save-system' module (automatically included as dependency).
