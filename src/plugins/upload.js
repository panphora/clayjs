/**
 * upload.js — store a file on the host instead of embedding it (spec §9).
 *
 * The problem this exists for: a document that cannot upload has to put the image
 * INSIDE itself as a data: URL. A two megabyte photo then costs 2.7 MB of base64
 * on this save, on every future save, and in every stored version. Embedding is
 * the right answer for a file nobody is serving, and the wrong answer everywhere
 * else, and until now clayjs had no way to tell the difference.
 *
 *   const result = await clay.upload(file, { onProgress, signal });
 *   // { ok, msg, msgType, code, uploads }
 *
 * The result NEVER rejects, matching the save lane. One shape from every exit,
 * because two channels for three outcomes (stored, cannot store here, failed) is
 * the exact pattern save-core.js documents as the source of its own past bugs: a
 * "cannot store here" thrown as an error reads as a failure, and a caller that
 * catches it embeds when it should have stopped, or stops when it should have
 * embedded.
 *
 * Codes a caller branches on:
 *   unsupported       this host does not store files; embedding is correct
 *   payment-required  the host stores files, but not for this account
 *   too-large         over the host's cap, refused here or by the host
 *   unsupported-type  the host will not store this kind of file
 *   timeout           no answer; the upload may or may not have landed
