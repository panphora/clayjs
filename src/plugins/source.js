/**
 * source.js — wire the source map into the save pipeline.
 *
 * On by default in edit mode; `exclude=source` turns it off. The mechanism lives in
 * core/source-map.js; this file is the
 * lifecycle around it: fetch the bytes this document was loaded from, pair them to
 * the page, render the save through them, verify, and re-pair when the file moves
 * under us.
 *
 * FOUR MOMENTS
 *
 *   boot          fetch the source, model it, refuse anything that is not this
 *                 document, and pair it against a save clone.
 *   save          render; verify; send the render if it verifies and today's full
 *                 serialization if it does not, counting the second case.
 *   accepted      re-model against the bytes the host took, so the next save is
 *                 measured from what is on disk rather than from what was there at
 *                 boot.
 *   sync-applied  re-pair, because a morph replaces live nodes and the map is keyed
 *                 by node identity.
 *
 * The last two share one deferred, coalesced refresh, so neither sits between a save
 * landing and the page hearing about it, and a burst of frames costs one walk.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE BLOCKS BOOT. The install is async and the loader does not wait for
 * it, because a save before it finishes is a save exactly as it is today. Waiting
 * would trade a guaranteed delay on every page for a better outcome on the rare save
 * that lands in the first few hundred milliseconds.
 *
 * WHEN IT DOES NOTHING
 *
 * Any of these leaves the save pipeline untouched, and each says so once in the
 * console rather than repeatedly at save time:
 *
 *   the source fetch fails, redirects, or is not text/html
 *   the fetched bytes disagree with the live document outside <html>
 *   the render throws
 *   the render does not verify

 * reprint, which changes the bytes while leaving the tree identical, and the verifier
 * must still pass it — a tree comparison is the right answer there, and reading that

 * `{ corrupt: 'drop-first-text' }` is the one that must be REJECTED: it changes the

 * differs; that element is printed in full and the render tried again, widening to the
 * parent while it still fails. Everything outside the printed elements is still the
 * author's bytes. Only when the widening reaches <html>, or the failure has no node to
 * point at (the prologue, a parse-error count), is today's full serialization sent.
