/**
 * clay.wire — a per-file control channel between this page and a local process.
 *
 * The page sends a request ("rewrite the section I circled"), a process running
 * in the user's own terminal answers with progress and a terminal frame, and
 * that process edits the FILE. HTML never rides the wire: the agent's change
 * reaches this page as an ordinary external file change, through live-sync. That
 * split is why this module has no morphing, no content lane, and no opinion
 * about what a payload contains.
 *
 * Three constraints shape everything below.
 *
 * It must not import the sync plugin. `sync/live-sync.js` opens an EventSource
 * on evaluation, so a static import here would give every wire page a live-sync
 * connection it never asked for. The one thing this module needs from live-sync,
 * "a disk frame just landed", arrives as the `clay:sync-applied` DOM event, which
 * couples the two through the document rather than through the module graph.
 *
 * It runs in view mode (`editOnly: false` in the loader's plugin table), because
 * the `/htmlfile questions` consumer and every read-only review page need it. So
 * nothing here may assume the save lane exists: on a view-mode page `clay.save`
 * is absent, and the save-protection below is skipped entirely rather than
 * guarded at each call site.
 *
 * The stream is lazy. A browser allows six connections per origin, the pool is
 * shared across tabs, and live-sync already holds one per tab, so a second
 * permanent stream means three tabs of one project saturate the origin and the
 * next save queues behind them. The wire is idle between requests by definition,
 * so it connects on the first in-flight request and disconnects after the last
 * one ends.

// Every request carries a deadline, from before its POST until it ends. Nothing
// else can end one: the wire has no "the handler detached" signal, and a handler
// that acknowledged and then died would otherwise leave the request open, its
// promise unresolved, and saving paused for the rest of the session. That is the
// worst outcome available here, worse than reporting a slow agent as failed,
// because the page silently stops saving.

// and is asking about.
//
// Suspend autosave while a request is in flight: the save is last-writer-wins
// with a backup, not a reject. An autosave landing inside the watcher's poll and
// quiet window posts the pre-agent document, the server backs the agent's bytes
// up and still writes the browser's, the watcher's revalidation then fails, and
// nothing is published. The handler reports done, the page shows success, and
// the agent's work exists only in Backups.
//
// The lever is the save lane's own suspension, not a mutation-hub pause. Two
// reasons. The [persist] input autosave never goes through the hub at all — it is
// a raw input listener and a timer (autosave.js) — so a hub pause misses the
// clobber it is supposed to prevent. And pausing the hub blinds the scoped-sync
// dirty gate, whose one invariant is that it may over-report but must never
// under-report: a DOM edit the user made during the request would then read as
